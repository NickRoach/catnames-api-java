This is the http REST API program for my catnames demonstration. It is written in Java using Spring Boot. It provides GET, POST and DELETE services for entries in an SQL database. I built the application into a .jar file using Maven, containerized the application with Docker and then deployed the containerized application on Google CloudRun. A SQL server instance was set up on Google Cloud SQL to serve as the database.
I  made a front end page to demonstrate the functionality of the back end. It can be seen live at https://nickroach.github.io/catnames/
